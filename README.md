# DeepMoleculeGen

This is the codes and data for implementing the Gen-DL model.
To train the Gen-DL model, the dataset that have all seven optical properties needs to be used.
Additionally, the Gen-DL model is publicly available as a web-based application (http://deep4chem.korea.ac.kr/DeepMoleculeGen). 
The experimental database can be available from https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-00634-8.
